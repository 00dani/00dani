### Hey there, everyone! This is Danielle! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a developer with a passion for expressive type systems and a drive to experiment with new technologies. Iâ€™m also a dorky nerd girl who likes fighting games. ðŸª€ðŸ§¸

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focused on smaller personal projects, such as [livemacros.vim](https://github.com/00dani/livemacros.vim) and [my various dotfiles repos](https://github.com/00dani/dot-dots).
- ðŸ¤” Professionally, Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer, but I'm currently looking for work.
- âš¡ When Iâ€™m not programming, I like to make [Letâ€™s Play videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj3NnmWWeWIv4qs0J-HhD5w).
